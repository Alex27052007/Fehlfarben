# Pseudocolor/False color converter (Fehlfarben)

Pseudocolor is a program that converts grayscale images in BMP format into false color images. It assigns RGB colors to different grayscale values based on zone values provided in a CSV file.

## Usage

To use the Pseudocolor converter, follow these steps:

Provide the grayscale image name as the first parameter.
Provide the zone value file name as the second parameter.
The converted image will be automatically opened and saved in the "results" directory with the prefix "converted_".

## Examples
You can find example images and zone value files in the root directory.
